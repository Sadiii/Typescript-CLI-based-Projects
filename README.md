## Deployment

All the projects are deployed on **npmjs** registery. 
You can install and test using following command.

```bash
  npx <project-name>
  or 
  npx i <project-name>
```


## Use the Projects

You can clone each project by running the following the command.

```bash
  git clone <repo url>
```
After that navigate to specific folder

```bash
  cd <project folder>
```
Then install all required dependencies
But you must need to install node js in your local machine because we are running typescript outside browser. So nodejs will act as a transalation engine.
```bash
 npm i
```

Now you can check the projects in .ts file and also run the project locally on your machine.
Transpile and run using the following command.

```bash
  tsc && node <filename.ts>
```
